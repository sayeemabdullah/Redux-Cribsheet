# Redux-React-Cribsheet

> Redux is a JavaScript state management library. It can be used with libraries like React and Angular. But in this cribsheet, we will use it with [React](https://github.com/sayeemabdullah/React-Cribsheet#readme).


## Three Core Concepts



## Getting Started
 

Before starting we should make sure that we have **React** and to create our app we have to first go to our desired folder and use the below command:

``` shell

npx create-react-app name-of-our-project

```

And now to start our project we will use the following command after going to our project directory which is **react-app** for me:

``` shell

npm start

```

And after that we will use the command below to install **redux and react-redux** in our project:

```shell

npm install redux react-redux 

```
