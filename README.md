# Redux-React-Cribsheet

> Redux is a JavaScript state management library. It can be used with libraries like React and Angular. But in this cribsheet, we will use it with [React](https://github.com/sayeemabdullah/React-Cribsheet#readme).


## Three Building Parts

The three-building parts of Redux are **Store**, **Action** and **Reducer**. In brief, we can say that store holds the state of our application, action describes what happened and the reducer ties the store and the actions together.

## Getting Started
 

Before starting we should make sure that we have **React** and to create our app we have to first go to our desired folder and use the below command:

``` shell

npx create-react-app name-of-our-project

```

And now to start our project we will use the following command after going to our project directory:

``` shell

npm start

```

And after that we will use the command below to install **redux and react-redux** in our project:

```shell

npm install redux react-redux 

```

As now we are ready we can start our implementation.
